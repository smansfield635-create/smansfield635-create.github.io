    <h2>ORIGIN</h2>
    <p>
      Geodiametrics did not begin as a scientific project or a software initiative.
      It began as a sustained attempt to understand why systems collapse—personal,
      social, organizational, and structural—despite intelligence, effort, or intent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Years of observing repeated failure modes led to the realization that collapse
      was not random, moral, or psychological. It was structural.
    </p>

    <h2>FORMATION</h2>
    <p>
      The work draws from philosophy, theology, systems thinking, and empirical
      execution. Early influences included Western philosophical inquiry alongside
      Chinese thought—Laozi, Zhuangzi, Confucius, and classical strategy texts—encountered
      directly through lived experience in China.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exposure to high social coherence under low personal freedom reframed questions
      of morality, structure, and constraint, permanently altering how problems were
      analyzed and tested.

    <h2>EXECUTION</h2>
    <p>
      This project does not claim authority, prediction, or inevitability.
      It documents execution under constraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Systems were built live, under stress, without institutional support,
      and without post-hoc redesign. What held is recorded. What failed is recorded.
      Interpretation is optional.

    <h2>POSITION</h2>
    <p>
      The author was born October 1, 1985, in Grand Prairie, Texas, and currently works
      in residential sales. All work presented here was developed independently.
    </p>
    <p>
      This site exists to show what was built, how it behaved, and what remained coherent
      under load—not to persuade or brand.
