    <h2>ORIGIN &amp; BACKGROUND</h2>

    <p><strong>EARLY LIFE.</strong> I was born on October 1, 1985, in Grand Prairie, Texas. My early life was marked by instability and adversity, which shaped a long path of self-cultivation rather than early specialization.</p>

    <p><strong>FORMATION THROUGH EXPERIENCE.</strong> It took many years to find internal alignment as an adult. That process involved repeated observation of personal, relational, and systemic collapse—followed by deliberate attempts to understand why collapse occurs and how stability is restored.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>INTELLECTUAL ORIENTATION</h2>

    <p><strong>PHILOSOPHICAL ROOTS.</strong> I am not formally trained as a scientist. My orientation is philosophical, with long-standing interest in philosophy, theology, and science as complementary lenses rather than competing domains.</p>

    <p><strong>QUESTION-FIRST DEVELOPMENT.</strong> My work emerged from questioning patterns rather than studying disciplines. Concepts such as constraints, canonical structure, or formal systems were encountered only after intuitive models repeatedly proved consistent under observation.</p>
  </section>

    <h2>CHINA &amp; CROSS-CULTURAL INFLUENCE</h2>

    <p><strong>EXPERIENCE IN CHINA.</strong> Time spent living in China had a decisive influence on how I think. Immersion in Chinese language and culture answered questions I had carried for years without knowing where to look.</p>

    <p><strong>PHILOSOPHICAL CONTINUITY.</strong> Exposure to classical Chinese thought—particularly traditions associated with Laozi, Zhuangzi, Mengzi, Confucian ethics, and strategic texts—revealed structural parallels between moral systems, social order, and stability.</p>

    <p><strong>LANGUAGE &amp; PERCEPTION.</strong> Learning Mandarin reshaped how I process meaning, ask questions, and detect ambiguity. Experiencing a society with comparatively low individual freedom but high social constraint clarified the role constraint plays in coherence.</p>

    <h2>INFLECTION POINT</h2>

    <p><strong>CHRISTMAS EPIPHANY.</strong> During a period of personal isolation, I encountered a simple realization: human behavior appears to obey constraints similar to physical systems. At the time, I had no exposure to social thermodynamics or formal systems theory.</p>

    <p><strong>SEQUENTIAL CONVERGENCE.</strong> That realization triggered a sequence of empirical exploration. Each step was verified through lived execution before terminology or theory followed. Language came last; structure came first.</p>

    <h2>PRESENT</h2>

    <p><strong>CURRENT WORK.</strong> I currently work in residential sales for LeafGuard gutters. All work presented here was developed independently, without institutional backing, during active life constraints.</p>

    <p><strong>GEODIAMETRICS.</strong> This site documents empirical execution, not credentials. It exists to show what was built, how it behaved, and what held under stress.</p>
  </section>

    <h2>SCOPE &amp; INTENT</h2>

    <p><strong>NO AUTHORITY CLAIM.</strong> This work does not claim authority, prediction, or inevitability. It documents execution, constraint alignment, and observable outcomes.</p>

    <p><strong>OPEN INSPECTION.</strong> Readers are invited to inspect structure, instrumentation, and failure modes directly. Interpretation is optional; evidence is not.</p>
