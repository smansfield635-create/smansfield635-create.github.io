  <!-- What this is -->
  <section class="panel">
    <h2>What this is</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      Execution Space is a bounded place to explore possible paths without forcing action.
      Nothing here commits, executes, or traps you.
    </p>
    <p class="muted">
      You can look, step back, or leave at any time.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Why it’s useful -->
  <section class="panel">
    <h2>Why this is useful</h2>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>It slows decisions just enough to make outcomes visible.</li>
      <li>It separates thinking from acting.</li>
      <li>It prevents irreversible mistakes made under pressure.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- The four stages -->
  <section class="panel">
    <h2>The four stages every decision follows</h2>

    <details open>
      <summary>Selection</summary>
      <p class="muted">
        What you allow into consideration. Not everything deserves attention.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Resolution</summary>
      <p class="muted">
        The rules that apply to what was selected. Constraints reduce harm.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Commitment</summary>
      <p class="muted">
        The moment a choice becomes real. Without this step, everything remains hypothetical.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Continuation</summary>
      <p class="muted">
        What happens next and what is learned. This is how systems adapt without collapsing.
      </p>
    </details>
  </section>

  <!-- Bounded state space -->
  <section class="panel">
    <h2>Why the space is bounded</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      Unlimited possibilities create confusion. A bounded space preserves clarity.
    </p>
    <p class="muted">
      With four stages and a limited depth of exploration, the system enumerates
      a finite set of meaningful paths instead of infinite ambiguity.
    </p>

    <details>
      <summary>What “64” means</summary>
      <p class="muted">
        When four stages are examined three steps deep, there are 4 × 4 × 4 = 64 possible sequences.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        This is not performance, hardware, or power. It is a human-scale limit for understanding.

      <li>Read the stages to understand how decisions move.</li>
      <li>Notice where real-life decisions skip or repeat steps.</li>
      <li>Use the structure to regain clarity before acting.</li>
