  <h1>The Problem</h1>

  <section>
    <p>
      Modern systems fail quietly. They degrade without warning, drift without detection,
      and collapse without accountability. Metrics exist, but they are fragmented, delayed,
      or optimized for appearances rather than truth.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>
      Existing tools measure performance after outcomes occur. They do not detect
      structural incoherence while it is forming. By the time failure is visible,
      the causal chain is already lost.
    </p>

    <p>
      This project addresses a single question: <strong>what remains coherent under pressure?</strong>
      If coherence can be observed directly, instability becomes measurable before collapse.
    </p>

  <section>
    <p>
      The system does not predict behavior. It constrains outcomes by enforcing
      consistency between stated intent, observable action, and resulting effects.
