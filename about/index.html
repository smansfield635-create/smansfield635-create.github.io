    <h2>ORIGIN</h2>
    <p><strong>CHRISTMAS EPIPHANY.</strong> During a period of personal isolation, a simple realization occurred: human behavior appears to obey constraints similar to physical systems. At the time, I had no knowledge of social thermodynamics, constraint theory, or formal systems language. I could not define “canonical,” nor did I understand what a constraint law was. The insight came first. The language followed later.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
    <p><strong>NON-ACADEMIC PATH.</strong> I am not a scientist by training. I am a philosopher by inclination, shaped by theology, science, and lived experience. My childhood was unstable, and it took many years of self-cultivation and personal collapse to recognize recurring structural failures in my own life.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>CHINA</h2>
    <p><strong>CULTURAL REORIENTATION.</strong> Time spent living in China fundamentally altered how I think, question, and observe. Exposure to Chinese philosophy—Laozi, Zhuangzi, Mengzi, Han Feizi, Sun Tzu, and Confucius—resolved questions Western frameworks never fully addressed.</p>
    <p><strong>MANDARIN IMMERSION.</strong> Learning Mandarin reshaped my relationship to meaning and structure. Experiencing a society with lower individual freedom but higher moral coherence revealed tradeoffs invisible from a Western lens.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>EXECUTION</h2>
    <p><strong>CONSTRAINT-FIRST PRACTICE.</strong> What followed was not theory but execution. One experiment led to another. Systems were built, collapsed, rebuilt, and instrumented. Structure emerged not through design intent, but through enforced limits.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>PRESENT</h2>
    <p><strong>CURRENT WORK.</strong> I currently work in residential sales for LeafGuard gutters. All work presented here was developed independently, without institutional backing, during active life constraints.</p>
    <p><strong>NO AUTHORITY CLAIM.</strong> This site documents execution, not credentials. It exists to show what was built, how it behaved, and what held under stress.</p>

    <h2>BIOGRAPHICAL NOTES</h2>
    <p><strong>BIRTH.</strong> October 1, 1985 — Grand Prairie, Texas.</p>
