# Geodiametrics — PRIVACY

## Principle
Geodiametrics prioritizes **public inspection without personal surveillance**.

No personal data is collected, stored, or processed by default.

---

## What Is Collected

### Device-Local Interaction (Optional)
- Page views
- Click counts
- Time-on-page

**Storage:**  
- Device-local only (browser localStorage)
- Never transmitted automatically
- Never aggregated across users

**Purpose:**  
- Operator intuition
- Manual snapshot review
- Non-authoritative signal only

---

## What Is NOT Collected
- Names
- Emails
- IP addresses
- Cookies
- Fingerprints
- Accounts
- Location
- Cross-device identifiers

---

## Public Metrics

### Site Metrics
Published numbers (if any) are:
- Manually curated
- Aggregated
- Non-identifying
- Traceable to a public JSON file

### OSF Metrics
- Sourced directly from OSF dashboards
- Mirrored manually
- OSF remains the canonical record

---

## Third-Party Services
None are required or embedded by default.

If added in the future, they must:
- Be explicitly disclosed
- Respect this document
- Never compromise observer anonymity

---

## Data Retention
- Device-local data persists until cleared by the user
- Public metrics persist as versioned records

---

## Changes
Any change to privacy behavior requires:
- Documentation update
- Version bump
- Public visibility

---

## Status
Layer 6 privacy policy established.
