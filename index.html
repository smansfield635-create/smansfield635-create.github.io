  <section class="panel">
    <h2>The Pattern</h2>

    <p>
      Progress does not begin with proof.<br/>
      It begins with the ability to imagine.
    </p>

    <ul class="story-list">
      <li>
        <strong>Roger Bannister</strong> ran the four-minute mile —
        after doctors warned the human body would collapse or die attempting it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Wright brothers</strong> bent metal and lifted it into the sky —
        when flight was considered fantasy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Thomas Edison</strong> harnessed electricity —
        before society understood what it was.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="note">
      In each case, the limitation was not physical.<br/>
      It was structural, psychological, and assumed.

  <!-- COHERENCE BRIDGE -->

    <p>
      You cannot discover coherence without first allowing the possibility of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      You cannot integrate what you refuse to see.
