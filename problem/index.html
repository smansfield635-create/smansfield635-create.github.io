  <h1>The Problem</h1>
</header>

<main>

  <section>
    <p><strong>EXECUTION FAILURE UNDER COMPLEXITY.</strong> Modern systems fail not because of insufficient intelligence, effort, or tooling, but because execution loses coherence as complexity increases. Decisions fragment, signals conflict, and progress becomes unmeasurable before failure is recognized.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p><strong>INVISIBLE FAILURE MODES.</strong> Most execution failures are not abrupt. They emerge gradually through misalignment between goals, constraints, and observable outcomes. Existing frameworks detect failure only after impact, not during formation.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p><strong>TOOLING WITHOUT DIAGNOSTICS.</strong> Current approaches emphasize planning, optimization, and performance metrics without providing a reliable way to diagnose whether execution itself remains coherent. Activity is mistaken for progress, and motion replaces verification.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p><strong>NARRATIVE OVER MEASUREMENT.</strong> Explanations of success and failure are often retrospective and narrative-driven. This obscures causal structure and prevents independent verification. Without instrumentation, claims cannot be falsified in real time.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p><strong>SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM.</strong> This failure pattern appears across domains, including software development, organizational operations, research programs, and complex decision-making systems. The specific domain varies; the structural failure does not.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p><strong>WHAT THIS SYSTEM DOES NOT CLAIM.</strong> This project does not claim to optimize outcomes, predict success, or replace domain expertise. It does not provide strategy, advice, or guarantees. Its sole concern is whether execution remains structurally coherent under constraint.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p><strong>BOUNDARY TO SOLUTION.</strong> This page defines the problem space only. Methods, diagnostics, instrumentation, and empirical findings are documented elsewhere. No solution mechanics are introduced here.</p>
