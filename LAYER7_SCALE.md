# Geodiametrics — LAYER 7: SCALE & EXTERNAL VALIDATION

## Purpose
Define how Geodiametrics moves from a self-consistent public instrument
to externally validated structure without compromising constraints.

This layer is about **others observing, testing, and replicating** —
not growth for its own sake.

---

## Entry Conditions
Layer 7 may begin only when:
- Control surface is stable
- Metrics standards are published
- Governance documents are frozen
- Execution remains disabled or explicitly versioned

---

## Validation Channels

### Independent Observers
- Third parties inspect the Control gauge
- Replication performed using REPLICATION.md
- Structural equivalence verified

### Academic / Research Review
- Canonical OSF records cited directly
- No reinterpretation via this site
- External commentary remains external

### Public Transparency
- Metrics remain inspectable
- Changes are versioned
- No silent upgrades

---

## Scaling Rules

### Allowed
- More observers
- More replications
- More artifacts
- More documentation

### Not Allowed
- Narrative inflation
- Authority claims
- Hidden automation
- Forced interpretation

---

## Signal of Success
Layer 7 is successful when:
- Independent replications exist
- External references cite OSF directly
- Control gauge remains boring and stable

---

## Exit Conditions
Scaling pauses or resets if:
- Metrics become ambiguous
- Execution leaks into observation
- Governance rules are bypassed

---

## Status
Layer 7 defined.
Execution optional.
