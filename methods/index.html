    <p><strong>PRIORITY KNOWLEDGE BOUNDARY.</strong> All pre-verbal, sensory, and intuitive inputs are treated as priority knowledge—providing access to signal without conferring authority. These inputs may inform exploration but may not override externally observable evidence, invariant structure, or proof-gated execution.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="tier">
    <h2>TIER 1 FINDING (FOUNDATIONAL)</h2>

    <p><strong>CONSTRAINT-FIRST EXECUTION GENERATES STRUCTURE.</strong> A functioning execution system can be constructed by enforcing constraints before optimization, narrative framing, or tooling selection. When constraints are primary, architecture emerges as a consequence rather than a design objective.</p>

    <p><strong>FOUNDATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE.</strong> This finding establishes that execution coherence is not dependent on prior expertise or incremental refinement, but on the correct ordering and enforcement of constraints.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="tier">
    <h2>TIER 2 FINDINGS (CORE MECHANISMS)</h2>

    <p><strong>ENGINE COHERENCE PRECEDES COMPONENT SPECIALIZATION.</strong> A unified execution engine can subsume roles typically treated as independent systems—such as hosting, application logic, validation, search, and interaction—when closure and proof rules are enforced globally rather than locally.</p>

    <p><strong>INSTRUMENTATION ENABLES DIAGNOSTIC EXECUTION.</strong> Execution becomes diagnosable only when state, activity, and transitions are explicitly recorded. Instrumentation is a prerequisite for determining whether execution is coherent, fragmenting, or stalled.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="tier">
    <h2>TIER 3 FINDINGS (DERIVED IMPLICATIONS)</h2>

    <p><strong>RAPID CONSTRUCTION UNDER STRESS IS A VALID PROOF SURFACE.</strong> Successful system construction under severe constraints—single device usage, cellular connectivity, and compressed time windows—provides stronger empirical evidence than builds performed under idealized conditions.</p>

    <p><strong>ARCHITECTURAL COLLAPSE IS A SIGNAL, NOT A FAILURE.</strong> When independent architectural concerns collapse into a single executable structure, the collapse indicates successful constraint convergence rather than oversimplification.</p>

    <p><strong>FAILURE MODES CONSTITUTE DIAGNOSTIC DATA.</strong> Execution failures that do not violate core invariants provide information about boundary conditions and system limits. Such failures are admissible data rather than disproof.</p>

    <p><strong>METHODS PAGE SCOPE.</strong> This page documents only the highest-level empirical findings. It does not enumerate procedures, execution rules, instrumentation mechanics, or validation workflows.</p>

    <p><strong>DOCUMENTATION STRUCTURE.</strong> Detailed mechanisms, diagnostics, and execution protocols are documented in subordinate pages branching from this Methods overview.</p>
