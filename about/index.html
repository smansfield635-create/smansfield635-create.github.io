  <h1>About</h1>

  <section class="card">
    <p><strong>ORIGIN.</strong> I am not a scientist by training. I am a philosopher by disposition—drawn from a young age to philosophy, theology, and science as ways of understanding coherence, collapse, and meaning.</p>

    <p>My early life was unstable. A troubled childhood and fractured family structure produced repeated cycles of breakdown rather than continuity. For many years, I experienced collapse without language for it.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <p><strong>TURNING POINT.</strong> In adulthood, a sustained process of self-cultivation and personal reconstruction began. Over time, a pattern emerged: collapse was not random. It followed structure.</p>

    <p>During a period of isolation one Christmas, an insight surfaced: human behavior appeared to obey constraints similar to physical systems. At the time, I did not know the terms “constraint,” “canonical,” or “social thermodynamics.” I only knew the pattern was repeatable.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <p><strong>CHINA.</strong> Time spent living in China profoundly reshaped my thinking. Immersion in Chinese culture, language, and philosophy—Laozi, Mengzi, Zhuangzi, Han Fei, Sun Tzu, and Confucius—resolved questions Western frameworks had left incoherent.</p>

    <p>Learning Mandarin and living inside a system with comparatively low individual freedom but high moral expectation inverted many assumptions I had absorbed growing up in the United States. The experience recalibrated how I ask questions, how I evaluate systems, and how coherence is maintained.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <p><strong>EXECUTION.</strong> What followed was not theory-first design. It was execution under constraint. Systems were built live, under stress, without credentials, institutional backing, or retroactive revision.</p>

    <p>Geodiametrics documents what executed, what held, what collapsed, and what proved invariant.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <p><strong>PRESENT.</strong> I was born October 1, 1985, in Grand Prairie, Texas. I currently work in residential sales for LeafGuard Gutters. All work documented here was developed independently.</p>

    <p>This project makes no claim of authority, prediction, or inevitability. It exists to show structure, execution, and evidence—nothing more.</p>
