# Geodiametrics — GOVERNANCE

## Principles
- Structure over narrative
- Constraints before execution
- Public inspection without interpretation enforcement

## Authority
- OSF projects are canonical records
- This site mirrors and routes, it does not override

## Execution
- Disabled by default
- Enabled only by explicit versioned release

## Changes
- All changes require version bump
- Frozen releases are immutable
